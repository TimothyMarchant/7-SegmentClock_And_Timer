This project involves the PIC16F18313 microcontroller and uses its timer modules to keep time.
This specific PIC only has 6 I/O pins, but I used the SN74HC165N and SN74HC595N shift registers for expanding I/O.
I left the C file with the required code and config file I used for the microcontroller.
I should also mention that you probably can use these exact same files for the PIC16F18323 since they use the same datasheet.
